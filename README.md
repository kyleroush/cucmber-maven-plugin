## What It Does

This is about how you can have common senarios across multiple feature file that you want to have managed in a single places but applied to mutltiple features
so what this does is given feature files it will check the tags on the feature and see if you have specified a subfeature that matches that tag and it will generate a new file with the all additional steps from all of the sub features.
